# **RFID Reader**

To assist in tracking animal behavior, particularly when multiple animals are present in the arena, unique RFID emitters can be attached or implanted subcutaneously to individual animals, and [Harp RFID reader devices](https://github.com/harp-tech/device.rfidreader) placed at key points of the arena (e.g. entry and exit points, close to a patch). The `RfidReader (Aeon.Environment)` node establishes a connection to an RFID reader and shares events generated by RFID proximity to shared `Subjects` reporting which animal is near which location.

## <u>RfidReader Node</u>

Create a `GroupWorkflow` node and name it appropriately, e.g. 'Patch1Rfid'. Place an `RFIDReader (Aeon.Environment)` node inside, connect to the workflow output and externalise all properties:

### Inputs and Outputs

***Inputs:*** - None

***Outputs:*** - Stream of all events emitted by the harp [RfidReader](https://github.com/harp-tech/device.rfidreader)

--------

### **Properties of the Node:**

#### ***General:***

| Property Name | Description                                               |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **HardwareNotificationsState** | Enables or disables hardware notifications <!-- Don't really get this --> |
| **Location** | The location, in pixel space, with which to associate detection events |
| **PortName** | The COM port the physical RFID reader is connected to |

### ***Subject names:***
Events from the RFID reader are and published to shared `Subjects`. Here you set the names used for these `Subjects` to identify events, commands or datastreams. These subjects become accessible in the bonsai editor's toolbox anywhere in the workflow using the name set in their properties.

### Subjects

An overview of the events and commands available or published to `Subjects`

#### Device Events Subject

| **Event2**        | `Type`      | Description of Event2                                                                             |

#### Other Output Subjects
Other subjects published or updated by the node, usually ater some processing
| **Subject**             | **Type**      | **Description**                                                                                   |
|-------------------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Output1**             | `Type`        | Description of Output1 |
| **Output2**             | `Type`        | Description of Output2 |

### Device Command Subjects
Existing subjects published outside of the node, but used for input or as a trigger
| Subject name       | Type    | Description                                                                           |
|-------------------|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Command1**      | `Type`      | Description of Command1                                                            |
| **Command2**      | `Type`      | Description of Command2                                                            |
