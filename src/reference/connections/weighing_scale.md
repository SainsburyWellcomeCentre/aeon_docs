# Weighing scale wiring schematic

In an AEON experiment, the weight of the animal is monitored regularly when they enter the [nest](./link/to/acquisition/nest.md)area, mounted on top of a [weighing scale].

## Connections

1. The weighing scales are provided with power from a COM port connection from the PSU.

2. A connection to the behaviour machine is made by wiring a connection through a RS232 port <!--TODO: check the pins-->
