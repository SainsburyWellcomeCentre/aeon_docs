# Camera wiring schematic

The <!--TODO-->[cameras](./link/to/acquisition/camera.md) record video of the experiment from different positions are triggered at one of two different frame rates by pulses generated by the [camera controller](./camera_controller.md)

## Connections
A USB-3.0 Micro-B connector connects each camera to the behaviour machine. The camera receive power and one of two trigger signals through a 6-core GPIO cable with connections soldered or otherwise made (we recommend [WAGO](https://www.wago.com/gb/) type connectors) from the PSU and breakout from the camera controller, to the shown pins.

1. 12V power lines from the PSU are connected <!--TODO check which pins are +/- --> to pins 1 and 6.

2. The trigger signals from the breakout of the [camera controller](./camera_controller.md) are connected <!--TODO check which pins are +/- --> to pins 2 and 5.

3. The camera itself is connected to USB-A connection on the behaviour machine from a USB 3.0 Micro-B USB port for frame acquisition.
