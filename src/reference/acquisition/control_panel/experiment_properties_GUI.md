# ExperimentProperties
The `ExperimentProperties (Aeon.Environment)` node creates a custom visualiser that provides direct access to any properties exposed at the highest level of the workflow through the control panel, allowing users to modify these properties during an experiment. 
The `Category` and `DisplayName` of the property nodes are displayed in this visualiser, enabling users to customise experimental properties as required.

In Aeon, this node is used to provide a drop down selector for specifying the "SelectedStream" property of the ["CameraSelector" `GroupWorkflow`](target-groupworkflow-cameraselector).
