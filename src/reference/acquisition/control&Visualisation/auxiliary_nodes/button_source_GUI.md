The `ButtonSource (Aeon.Environment)` node constructs a single labelled button displayed in its visualiser, and produces an observable sequence of `Harp.Timestamped<string>` when the button is pressed. Typically this sequence would then be cast to a shared `Subject`, with subscriptions elsewhere in the workflow effecting the button's impact on control, acquisition or experiment logic.
