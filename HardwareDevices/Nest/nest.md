# Nest / weighing scale

## Device Configuration
 Create a `Groupworkflow` called 'Nest'. Inside, place a `WeightScale (Aeon.Acquisition)` node, externalise it's properties and connect to the `WorkflowOutput`:

 ![WeightScale](./Workflows/weightScale.svg)

This node establishes a serial connection to the weighing scale, allowing direct control to read the weight, as well as send tare commands to the scale. The weightScale device node also processes the weight data from the scale to calculate a baseline weight that can be subtracted on a trigger. The node also filters the weight signal with a linear regression filter over a sliding window defined in the [properties](#properties-of-the-node). Finally, a measure of confidence for each of these readings is calculated. These measures are packaged into `Aeon.Environment.WeightMeasurement` class, each composed of the `Harp.Timestamp`, `Value` and the `Confidence` index of the weight measure.

### ***Subject names:***
Events and commands from the scale are collected from, and published to `Subjects`, in some cases after some processing. Here you set the names used for these `Subjects` to identify events, commands or datastreams for this device. Device events subects become accessible in the bonsai editor's toolbox anywhere in the workflow using the name set here.

## GUI

No specific GUI components are defined for this device.

## Logging

Outputs from the nest module are collected and formatted into harp messages using the `Harp.Format` and custom `FormatWeight` nodes to configure the register addresses for each data stream on a virtual harp device, utilising commonly available registers. Logging of this virtual harp device can then be performed as with any harp device using the  [`LogHarpState (Aeon.Acquisition)`](../../Logging/LogHarpState.md) node.

## State Persistence

Weight measurements are not required for environment state persistence

## Alerts

Weight measurements are currently not configured for alerts, though one could configure alert messages to alert the team to, for example, drops in measured weight below a threshold for a given animal.
