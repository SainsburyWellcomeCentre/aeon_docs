# Soft Modules

A number of modules in Project AEON are not driven directly by any hardware but act on data streams or events originating from a hardware module to generate new outputs to monitor animal behaviour in real time for quantification and logging of, but also to trigger task control events in response to specific events.

We think of these as 'soft devices' in that while they are not a hardware device themselves, they behave much like any other device, with inputs and triggers linked to hardware and generating events in synchrony with other hardware events.
