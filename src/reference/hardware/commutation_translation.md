# Commutation-Translation System
To minimise the tethering cable's interference with natural behaviour and prevent tangling during extended periods of recording, the Neuropixels commutation-translation system integrates the [ONIX commutator](https://open-ephys.org/commutator-info) with a servo motor-powered linear actuator, enabling closed-loop adjustment based on the animal's 2D position and head direction.
