# User Guide
This guide contains tutorials and how-to guides for using Aeon. 
The tutorials offer a broader, goal-oriented context, and contain end-to-end examples of how Aeon can be used to collect, process and analyse data. 
The how-to guides offer a more focused, task-oriented context, and provide detailed instructions on how to use specific features or modules of Aeon.

To demonstrate Aeon's various features and capabilities, we also provide the following sample datasets that complement the user guide.

- [**Single mouse in a foraging assay**](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13881884): A two-hour snippet of a single mouse in a foraging assay consisting of three food patches.
