# Spinnaker Camera

Cameras on an AEON system are typically triggered using synchronised trigger events emitted by a harp [CameraController (Gen2)](https://github.com/harp-tech/device.cameracontrollergen2) device. Prior to adding cameras to the system, one would usually set this device up in the workflow first. The [VideoController guide](../CameraController/videoController.md) details how to set this up.

This guide will walk through how a spinnaker camera is added and configured to an AEON Bonsai workflow; the outputs, control and logging workflows.

## <u>Device configuration</u>

### Placing a camera source:

Create a `GroupWorkflow` with an appropriate name for this camera e.g. `"CameraTop"`. 
Inside, place a `SpinnakerVideoSource (Aeon.Acquisition)` node, externalise all properties, and connect it to the `WorkflowOutput`:

![Aeon.Acquisition.Camera](./Workflows/camera.svg)

This node establishes a connection and configuration of a specific camera.

## **Properties of the node:**
### ***Camera settings:***

| **Property Name**  | **Description**                                                                                       |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Binning**        | Set the size of the binning area of the sensor.                                                       |
| **ExposureTime**   | Set the exposure time per frame. If the trigger frequency is too high to accommodate the exposure time here, it will be overridden. |
| **Gain**           | Gain on the sensor.                                                                                   |
| **SerialNumber**   | Serial number of the camera to acquire frames from.                                                   |


### ***Subject names:***
Events and commands from the camera are collected from and published to `Subjects`. Here you set the names used for these `Subjects` to identify events and triggers for this specific camera.

## **Subjects**:
### **Device Event Subjects**:

| **Subject**     | **Type** | **Description**                                                      |
|-----------------|----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **FrameEvents** | `Harp.Timestamped<Aeon.Acquisition.VideoDataFrame>` | Stream of camera frame events, ideally with one frame per trigger event. This stream is also output directly from the node |

### **Device Command Subjects**:

| **Subject**          | **Type** | **Description**                                              |
|----------------------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **TriggerFrequency** | `double` | Stores frequency of the incoming trigger. The value of this `Subject` is set in your [videoController](../CameraController/videoController.md) |
| **TriggerSource**    | `Harp.Timestamped<Harp.CameraControllerGen2.CameraEvents>` |Set the `Subject` that will act as a source for trigger events to this camera. This is generated by your [videoController](../CameraController/videoController.md) |

## GUI

TBC

## Logging
All events are logged using a `LogVideo` (`Aeon.Acquisition`) node, detailed further in [LogVideo.md](../../Logging/LogVideo.md)

![Aeon.Acquisition.logVideo](../../Logging/Workflows/logVideo.svg)

This node saves the video itself in dedicated `.avi` files encoded with the **FMP4 codec**. Harp and hardware timestamps and the frame counter recorded at the camera are logged in corresponding `.csv` files with the following columns:

*Data Schema*:
| Column name             | Type | Description                                          |
|-------------------------|------|------------------------------------------------------|
| time                    | F64  | Harp timestamp for this frame                        | 
| hw_counter              | I64  | Camera hardware frame counter. Should be consecutive |
| hw_time                 | I64  | Hardware (camera) timestamp for this frame           |

The `.csv` data files are matched to the `.avi` movies, i.e. the first row of the data file correspond to the first frame of the movie.

## State persistence
Not required for state recovery
## Alerts
Camera streams are monitored for stream timeouts and dropped frames, usually resulting from power outages or connection issues. Dedicated extensions detect these failure events and their outputs formatted and sent to the `EnvironmentAlerts` and `AlertLogs` `Subjects` to send and log an alert respectively.

The [Environment alerts guide](../../Alerts/environmentAlerts.md) details the implementation and configuration of these alerts and logs.

### Dropped Frames Monitor:

The `DroppedFrames (Extensions)` node monitors a sequence of FrameEvents from a specified `Subject` e.g. `CameraTop`. Specifically, it monitors the frameID to ensure frames arrive consecutively. In the event that a frame is dropped the node outputs the `Timestamp`, `Name` of the camera and the `frameID` of the dropped frame.

![DroppedFrames](./Workflows/droppedFrames.svg)

#### **Properties of the node:**
| **Subject**          | **Description**                                                                         |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **StreamEvents**     | Set the name of the events `Subject` output from a camera stream to be monitored        |

From the output of this node, an alert string can be configured and formatted, and sent to the `EnvironmentAlertMessages` and `AlertLogs` `Subjects` to send and log an alert respectively. 

### StreamTimeout Monitor:

The `StreamTimeout (Extensions)` node similarly monitors a sequence of FrameEvents from a specified `Subject` e.g. `CameraTop`. Specifically, it monitors the actual time between receiving frames to ensure frames arrive within a given `DueTime` property. In the event that no new frames arrive in time, the node outputs the Timestamp, name of the camera and the frameID of the dropped frame.

![StreamTimeout](./Workflows/streamTimeout.svg)

To avoid false alarms when cameras are not active, subscription to the `StreamTimeout` workflow is controlled using the same triggers that activate and stop the cameras through the `VideoController` as detailed in the [videoController guide](..//CameraController/videoController.md)

#### **Properties of the node:**

#### ***Device Events***:
| **Property Name** | **Description** |
|--|--|
| **StreamEvents:** | Set the name of the events `Subject` output from the camera stream to be monitored 
| **DueTime:** | Set the maximum time between values to trigger a timeout event |

### </u>Sending Alerts</u>:
From the output of both of these nodes, alert strings can be configured and formatted, and sent to the `EnvironmentAlertMessages` and `AlertLogs` `Subjects` for reporting. 

![CameraAlerts](./Workflows/cameraAlerts.svg)

### </u>Merging mutliple monitored streams</u>:
Multiple instances of the `DroppedFrames` and `StreamTimeout` nodes can be merged before passing to the Alert `Subjects` to monitor multiple camera streams simultaneously. Place these together in a `GroupWorkflow` and `Merge` the results, outputting to the `WorkflowOutput` to propogate the message for formatting and sending.
