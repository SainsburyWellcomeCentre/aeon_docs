# How-to Guides
These guides provide focused, task-oriented instructions for using Aeon's features and modules. 
They are designed to help you accomplish clearly defined goals&mdash;such as setting up a data pipeline, working with the [APIs](target-api-reference), or performing common analyses.

While the [tutorials](target-tutorials) offer a broader, learning-oriented perspective on the Aeon ecosystem, how-to guides are practical, hands-on resources for solving real-world tasks step by step.
