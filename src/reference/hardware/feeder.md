4\. Lower the disk into the feeder base making sure to orient the grub screw tapped hole toward the flat surface previously created on the motor metal pin (see step 1). Push down the disk until the top of the pin is flushed to the disk itself and use a grub screw (ID 10) to hold the disk in place. Make sure the grub screw touches the flat surface of the trimmed motor pin.
