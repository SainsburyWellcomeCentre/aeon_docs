# Tutorials
These tutorials offer a guided introduction to Aeon's experimental and data pipelines.
They are designed to help you build foundational understanding of how the Aeon ecosystem works and how its components relate.

While the [how-to guides](target-how-to) focus on accomplishing specific tasks, these tutorials support your broader learning journey.
You can also explore our [template workflow](aeon-template-github:) to see how Aeon's core building blocks come together in a complete experimental acquisition system.
