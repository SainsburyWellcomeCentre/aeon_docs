# Project Aeon

ProjectAeon is a collaborative effort to perform behavioral neuroscience experiments where the behavior and neural activity of freely moving animals engaging in a complex task are continuously recorded. This project spans [multiple repositories](target-repositories) and is contributed to by researchers and support staff at UCL's SWC, Neurogears, and Datajoint.

If you are interested in joining this project, please contact the [project maintainers](target-project-maintainers).
