The nest is designed to provide a dedicated nesting site and access to water, while continuously monitoring the weight of the animals. 
A nesting box is attached to a scale for precise weight measurement, and it is surrounded by modified [habitat](target-habitat) outer walls. 
A water bottle can be suspended on the side of the nesting box, with its spout protruding into the nest through a wall opening. 
The nest is typically equipped with bedding materials and enrichment.

### Scale support
::::{dropdown} Steps 1-3
:::{figure} ../../images/nest-step1.svg
:alt: step1
:class: img-hardware-steps
:figclass: caption-hardware-steps
1\. Create the scale support by bolting the acrylic platform to the two aluminium extrusions.

:class: img-hardware-steps
:figclass: caption-hardware-steps
2\. Remove the metal weighing pan from the scale and insert the 3D printed nest holders. This allows for direct attachment of the nest to the scale ensuring its stability.

:figclass: caption-hardware-steps
3\. Drill two holes in each aluminium extrusion and using 4 acrylic spacers, bolt the scale to the bottom of the metal framework as shown.

### Nest bottom
::::{dropdown} Steps 4-7

:class: img-hardware-steps
:figclass: caption-hardware-steps
4\. Using chloroform, bond the 2 white acrylic bottom pieces, one of which will slot into the 3D printed nest holders.

5\. Attach the red acrylic sides to the nest bottom.
:::

:class: img-hardware-steps
:figclass: caption-hardware-steps
6\. Attach front (red) and back (white) to the nest bottom.

:class: img-hardware-steps
:figclass: caption-hardware-steps
7\. The base of the nest will sit directly on the scale by slotting into the nest holders. This area will be filled with nesting material and enrichment, like chew sticks, during the experiments.

### Nest walls
::::{dropdown} Steps 8-10 
:::{figure} ../../images/nest-step8.svg
:alt: step8
:class: img-hardware-steps
:figclass: caption-hardware-steps
8\. Attach the back acrylic wall (white) to the wall sides (red). One of the sides has an opening for the water bottle spout.

:class: img-hardware-steps
:figclass: caption-hardware-steps
9\. Attach the nest outer walls (red). These will connect to the habitat outer walls.
:::
:::{figure} ../../images/nest-step10.svg
:alt: step10
:class: img-hardware-steps
:figclass: caption-hardware-steps
10\. Position the nest base and walls onto the habitat, above the scale. The base of the nest sits directly on the scale held by the 3D printed holders, while the walls connect to the habitat outer walls.

### Water bottle holder
::::{dropdown} Steps 11-13
:::{figure} ../../images/nest-step11.svg
:alt: step11
:class: img-hardware-steps
:figclass: caption-hardware-steps
11\. Assemble a T shape aluminium extrusions support for the water bottle.
:::
:::{figure} ../../images/nest-step12.svg
:alt: step12
:class: img-hardware-steps
:figclass: caption-hardware-steps
12\. Connect the 3D printed water bottle holder to the support.
:::
:::{figure} ../../images/nest-step13.svg
:alt: step13
:class: img-hardware-steps
:figclass: caption-hardware-steps
13\. Bolt the water bottle holder on the side of the nest using angle brackets. Adjust its inclination to fit the spout into the side wall opening. To prevent unstable scale readings, ensure that the spout does not come into contact with the acrylic.
