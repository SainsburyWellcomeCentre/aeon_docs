# EnvironmentState
The `EnvironmentState (Aeon.Environment)` node is a special case of a labelled button, operating similarly to [`ButtonSource`](target-node-buttonsource), but returning an observable sequence of type `Aeon.Environment.EnvironmentStateMetadata`, which details the name of the experimental environment and the current state of the environment.
The visualiser for this node provides a single labelled button that toggles between different "EnvironmentStates".

In Aeon, this is used to switch between "Maintenance" and "Experiment" states. 
The generated observable sequence generated by button presses, which reflects changes in the environment state, is broadcast through a shared `Subject`. 
This `Subject` is then subscribed to at various points in the experimental workflow to log state changes with the data, modify parameters and logic, and alter hardware behaviour accordingly.
