# Project Aeon

ProjectAeon is a collaborative effort to perform behavioral neuroscience experiments where the behavior and neural activity of freely moving animals engaging in a complex task are continuously recorded. This project is contributed to by researchers and support staff at UCL's SWC, Neurogears, and Datajoint.

If you are interested in joining this project, please contact the [project maintainers](target-project-maintainers).

:::{note}
All experiment data is acquired and/or triggered and/or synced by [Harp devices](https://www.cf-hw.org/harp). Code in the 'aeon_acquisition' and 'aeon_mecha' repos makes use of the [Harp protocol](https://github.com/harp-tech/protocol) during data acquisition, raw data file writing, and raw data file reading. In the 'harp-tech/protocol' Github repo, you can find documentation on [Harp device operation and common registers](https://github.com/harp-tech/protocol/blob/master/Device%201.0%201.4%2020200901.pdf), the [Harp binary protocol](https://github.com/harp-tech/protocol/blob/master/Binary%20Protocol%201.0%201.1%2020180223.pdf), and [Harp clock synchronization](https://github.com/harp-tech/protocol/blob/master/Synchronization%20Clock%201.0%201.0%2020200712.pdf).
