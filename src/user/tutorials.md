# Tutorials
These tutorials introduce Aeon's experimental and data pipelines in a goal-oriented, learning-focused way.
They are designed to help you build foundational understanding&mdash;how the Aeon ecosystem works and how its components relate.

Unlike the [how-to guides](target-how-to), which focus on specific tasks, tutorials support your broader learning journey.
We also provide a [template workflow](aeon-template-github:) to demonstrate the core building blocks of an experimental acquisition system using Aeon.
